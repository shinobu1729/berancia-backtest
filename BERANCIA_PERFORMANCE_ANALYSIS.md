## Performance Comparison

### 1-Year Extended Simulation Results

| Strategy | Final Position | ROI | Advantage vs Berancia |
|----------|----------------|-----|---------------------|
| **üèÜ Berancia (Auto)** | **993.72** | **893.7%** | **Baseline** |
| LBGT (1d) | 849.40 | 749.4% | -144.3% |
| iBGT (1d) | 784.69 | 684.7% | -209.0% |

### Performance Multipliers
- **1.19x** better than LBGT strategy
- **1.31x** better than iBGT strategy

## Why Berancia Outperforms

### 1. üéØ **Intelligent Dynamic Routing**

Berancia automatically routes capital to the **highest-priced LST token** at each decision point:

| Token | Routing Frequency | Market Share |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| yBGT | 11,970 times | 45.2% |
| iBGT | 7,772 times | 29.3% |
| LBGT | 6,749 times | 25.5% |

**Key Insight**: Berancia captured the best opportunities across all tokens, with yBGT being the most frequently selected high-performer, demonstrating its ability to identify and capitalize on optimal yield opportunities.

### 2. ‚ö° **Continuous Compounding Advantage**

| Strategy Type | Compound Frequency | Advantage |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Berancia (auto_0m)** | **Continuous (every ~3.17 minutes)** | **Maximum growth capture** |
| Individual Strategies | Daily (24-hour intervals) | Limited growth capture |

**Mathematical Impact**: Continuous compounding allows Berancia to capture and reinvest gains immediately, leading to exponential growth advantages over time.

### 3. üìà **Adaptive Market Response**

- **Static Strategies**: Individual token strategies are locked into one asset regardless of market conditions
- **Dynamic Strategy**: Berancia adapts in real-time, always selecting the optimal token based on current prices

## Technical Implementation

### Routing Algorithm
```
For each time period:
1. Evaluate all LST token prices (LBGT, iBGT, yBGT)
2. Select token with highest price_in_bera
3. Route all capital to optimal token
4. Compound gains continuously
```

### Compound Strategy Comparison
- **Berancia**: Revenue ‚Üí Position every ~197 seconds
- **Individual**: Revenue ‚Üí Position every 24 hours

## ROI Breakdown

### Original Historical Data (March 2025)
- **Berancia**: 46.30% ROI
- **Best Individual (LBGT)**: 42.13% ROI
- **Early advantage**: +4.17%

### 1-Year Extended Simulation
- **Berancia**: 893.7% ROI
- **Best Individual (LBGT)**: 749.4% ROI
- **Compounded advantage**: +144.3%

## Market Analysis

### Token Performance Insights
Based on routing frequency analysis, the LST token market dynamics show:

1. **yBGT**: Most frequently optimal (45.2% of decisions)
2. **iBGT**: Moderately optimal (29.3% of decisions)  
3. **LBGT**: Least frequently optimal (25.5% of decisions)

This data demonstrates the value of dynamic allocation versus static positioning in any single token.

## Conclusion

Berancia's **dynamic routing + continuous compounding** strategy delivers:

1. **üéØ Smart Capital Allocation**: Always routes to highest-performing asset among LBGT, iBGT, and yBGT
2. **‚ö° Maximum Compound Growth**: Continuous reinvestment vs daily limitations  
3. **üìä Consistent Outperformance**: 19-31% better returns across all individual token strategies
4. **üîÑ Market Adaptability**: Responds to changing token performance in real-time

**Bottom Line**: Berancia transforms static LST token strategies into an intelligent, adaptive yield optimization system that consistently captures the best opportunities in the Berachain LST ecosystem.
